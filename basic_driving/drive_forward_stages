# an example of a staged approach to driving to a position goal. starts faster and slows as it approaches the target position.
# developed and tested on a Clearpath Ridgeback in Simulation, not for use on a real platform without additional review and testing
# considerations - no obstacle detection, only using wheel encoder data
